_Intelligence-Simulations_
------
__Description__  
Experimental program to visualize swarm intelligence and similar other intelligence simulations.
  
*Note that this program is compiled in, and in turn requires, Java 8 in order to run.*

__Sample Images__  
Images saved using the program's own save feature, that I have found to be good samples of the program's capabilities over the development process can be found here: http://ultraimg.com/album/jQz  
  
*Please note that the .gitignore has an entry to ignore all .png files inside the desktop section of the project. This is to prevent any pictures taken during testing/development to be pushed to the repository.*
